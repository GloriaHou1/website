    <h1>Smart Investors</h1>
    <p>To promote transparency and easy access to the Financial markets</p>

    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>The Smart Investor Growth Miracle Alpha Fund is an active portfolio that consists of around 20 mid cap and large cap stocks from developing countries and other instruments. The main goal of the portfolio is to generate capital appreciation through both stock selection and market timing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="box-1">
    <h3>Index Component</h3>
    <p>The index’s component will consist of both equity and bond investments – however the proportion is not fixed. The equity proportion of the index will be determined by market performance and our market timing indicator (through sentiment analysis and price-volume analysis). During uptrends, the entire portfolio will be equity; during downtrends and uncertain situations, the portfolio will consist of less equity and more fixed income assets. For the equity part of the portfolio, we choose 80% of our portfolio from developing economies, 10% of our portfolio in alternative investments and 10% of our portfolio in various instruments in developed markets. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box-1">
    <h3>Benchmark Selection</h3>
    <p>Conventionally, an equity portfolio’s performance should be compared to a major equity index that it is based on; a mixed portfolio should be compared to the weighted benchmark return from each category – some other portfolios choose interest rate and other measures. Our benchmark is set to the value-weighted average of real GDP growth of the countries which we invest in. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box-1">
    <h3>Our Deviation from Standard Practices</h3>
    <p>Instead of stating an expected return, stock-bond proportion, or expected volatility – our fund focuses on seeking alpha while reducing our systematic risk by adjusting stock-bond proportion during down-trends.
      <ol>
        <li>We believe individual alpha is easier to find than commonly believed. The fact that different stocks have hugely different trading volume, even weight-adjusted, signals that investors’ attention are scattered. The market gets the price right eventually, but never immediately. This is especially true in the developing markets.</li>
        <li>We believe systematic alpha is easier to find than commonly believed. Firstly, we do not find sufficient evidence that even the weakest form of market efficiency holds. Secondly, and additionally, there are clear trends with most stock market indices. Exploiting the existence of beta when market is in uptrend and avoiding loss during downtrends is itself an alpha-generating strategy.</li>
        <li>We believe stock-bond proportion adjustment is more important than quantitative risk analysis (for example, risk parity model) by our strategic historic back test. Also, we believe economic analysis of international politics can be quite useful for.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Discussion on Risks</h3>
    <p>Many professionals use volatility, VaR, Sharpe Ratio, Calmer Ratio and all other standards to characterize risk – we agree that these standards are great for looking back – but unless these ratios stay consistent, they are only ways to look back. So in a sense these standards are similar to “historical return” as a standard for portfolio. It only describes the past but is limited for the future. Of course, risk is important consideration in investing. We choose to see risk this way: risk is the likelihood of making a negative return over a specific time period. Volatility is bad only if you use high leverage – if the stock is going up, or even sideways, volatility itself does no harm – it is what gives options value.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="box-1">
    <h3>Our theories and methodologies</h3>
    <p>One of our belief on the current market condition is that the equity market in North America is over-valued, while the equity market in China (Shanghai and Shenzhen) and Hong Kong are quite under-valued. This belief is the main foundation of our analysis and investment decisions.On individual stock selection, we only pick profitable mid-cap or high-cap public companies that have showed consistent growth and profit, yet undervalued (as indicated by low PE and PB). After the initial stock selection, we use machine learning techniques and back tests to discover specific trading patterns and abnormal price movements in our portfolio in order to choose entrance and exit points and continuously trade on the stock until an appropriate exit where we liquidate all holdings of the stock from our portfolio.</p>
