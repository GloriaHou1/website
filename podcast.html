		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<h4>Dear Listeners,</h4>
		<p>Thank you for visiting Smart Investors Podcast, and we think it is essential to convey the reason we came up with this podcast and how we are going to deliver.

   		In the first two years of the founding of the Smart Investors Club in 2016, the club achieved great success along with the students who joined our equity research groups, but we want to make a greater impact on the students â€“who may not want to commit to meetings weekly but still interested in learning finance. In 2019, we determined to commence the Podcast project in order to reach a greater number of audiences with great time flexibility and open up new communication channels that are novel in the UofT community.

   		Smart Investors Podcast is our brand-new audio channel beginning in September of 2019. We aimed to target audience with some general background in finance and is looking to learn more about the different branches of finance by conversation. Each episode will tackle on one business line in finance with one guest speaker to learn more about the industry reality.

  		Each episode will be updated bi-weekly and is about 20 minutes. We will invite different guest speakers and chat with them for each audio. The guest speakers usually are students/ grads working in the financial industry.

   		Please feel free to explore the audios, you definitely will find them interesting. Hopefully, we can bust some myths and nuances that you assumed. Lastly, we welcome all of you to comment any finance topic you want to discuss.</p>
